You became a victim of the NOT-PETYA-AGAIN RANSOMWARE!
---------------------------------------------
The drives of your computer have been encrypted with an advanced
military grade encryption algorithm known as AES to which the key
that encrypted the harddisks and that is also used for decryption has
now been erased from this system.

The only way to retrieve this decryption key is by doing the following
3 steps below:

1) Swear to god that you will not fall for it again!
2) Go to not-petya-again-decryptor.github.io or the NotPetyaAgain-Decryptor 
repo on GitHub.
3) Enter your victim ID (provided below) via the website or script and the
decryption key will be provided.

IMPORTANT: Once decryption begins, DO NOT restart or shutdown your device,
NotPetyaAgain will do so automatically.

Here is your personal victim ID:
