You became a victim of the NOTPETYAAGAIN RANSOMWARE!
----------------------------------------------------
The drives of your computer have been encrypted with an advanced
military grade encryption algorithm known as AES.
However, the key used for encryption and decryption of your 
harddisks has now been discarded and lost except for the victim ID
used to generate said key.

The only remaining way to get the decryption key is by following 3 steps:

1) Swear to god that you will not run any more malware!
2) Go to not-petya-again-decryptor.github.io or the NotPetyaAgain-Decryptor 
repo on GitHub.
3) Enter your PVID (provided below) via the website or script and the
decryption key will be generated and provided.

IMPORTANT: Once decryption begins, DO NOT RESTART OR TURN OFF YOUR PC!
NotPetyaAgain will restart your PC automatically.
