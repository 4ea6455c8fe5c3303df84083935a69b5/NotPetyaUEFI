You became a victim of the NOTPETYAAGAIN RANSOMWARE!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The drives of your computer have been encrypted with an advanced
military grade encryption algorithm known as AES.
However, the key used for encryption and decryption of your 
harddisks has now been discarded and lost except for the victim ID
used to generate said key.

Luckily, I'm a nice guy who just wants to research about UEFI malware,
so to get your files back, follow these 3 easy steps:

1) Swear on god that you will NOT run any more malware!
2) Go to not-petya-again-decryptor.github.io or the NotPetyaUEFI repo 
on GitHub.
3) Enter your PVID (provided below) via the website or script and the
decryption key will be generated and provided.

IMPORTANT: Once decryption begins, DO NOT RESTART OR TURN OFF YOUR PC
UNTIL THE DECRYPTION ROUTINE IS DONE!

Your Personal Victim ID (PVID):
